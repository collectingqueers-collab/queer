               <p>"I based this off of me when I was still a child and about 6 years old.
	           <br><br>
	           My school had this patch of grass where I'd enjoy playing and sitting down by myself. Because of my eccentricity, I had a friend count of only one, and we would have lunch together sometimes, but I think that day, she had something else to do, so I spent the rest of lunch by myself after eating.
               <br><br>
               I just wanted to see myself happy, I think. Which is why I drew this. I don't remember much of my elementary years except for the humiliating parts, so I liked a reminder of one of my more peaceful moments."</p>

      <p>“The artwork does mean quite a bit to me since I made it at not the best time in my life, and it's a reminder for me of those moments.<br>
<br>
I remembered the phrase "art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable." Then I wondered if I made a character based entirely on it whenever I felt tired of myself, so this girl in a straitjacket was born with a design, and then I drew her in a way that looked like she was in perpetual pain.<br>
<br>
I chose to give her a straitjacket because, well, she's in a psychiatric hospital of some sort and needing to be restrained. I wanted to make it look as uncomfortable as possible, and gave her a weird mechanism on her head which forces her mouth open.<br>
<br>
Some people hate going to the dentist, and I've even met some that hate the thought of teeth in general. I guess I wanted to simulate the distress of seeing gums and teeth and a mouth stretched wide<br>
<br>
I imagine what my life would be if I were to ever be the one restrained in the straitjacket, and even imagined myself as said 'girl in straitjacket' at times while drawing her. Now that I'm in what could objectively be considered a "better state of mind" by other people, I haven't drawn the girl as much as I did, and haven't been thinking of scenarios where I am her.”
