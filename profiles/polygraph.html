                    <p>
                        I think I lost my gender<br>
                        somewhere between<br>
                        the third repeat of The League of Gentlemen<br>
                        and my mum shouting<br>
                        that I’d rot my brain<br>
                        watching “that rubbish.”<br>
                        Fair.<br>
                        Because once you’ve met Royston Vasey,<br>
                        nothing fits back in the box properly.<br>
                        I didn’t wake up one day different.<br>
                        I just woke up<br>
                        after it all <br>
                        After the confidence of someone<br>
                        who didn’t ask permission<br>
                        to be strange<br>
                        and never once apologised for it.<br>
                        Cheers for that Barbara <br><br>
                        
                        On BBC Two at an hour meant for ghosts.<br>
                        People who looked wrong on purpose.<br>
                        People who didn’t tidy themselves up<br>
                        to make anyone else comfortable.<br>
                        And something in me went,<br>
                        oh.<br>
                        You can do that?<br>
                        I think my gender slipped away<br>
                        during The Mighty Boosh too —<br>
                        somewhere between Old Gregg<br>
                        and whatever Noel Fielding was wearing<br>
                        that week.<br>
                        When everyone was fluid,<br>
                        and glittery,<br>
                        and no one stopped the show<br>
                        to ask but what are you really?<br>
                        No panel.<br>
                        No debate.<br>
                        Just vibes and chaos<br>
                        and a bass line.<br>
                        People act like this stuff is new.<br>
                        Like we weren’t all raised by television<br>
                        that actively refused to explain itself.<br>
                        You can cope with<br>
                        a small town full of monsters,<br>
                        blackface nightmares,<br>
                        and characters who should legally come with warnings —<br>
                        but someone being a bit ambiguous?<br>
                        Too far.<br>
                        Nation in crisis.<br>
                        Sure.<br>
                        I tried to find my gender again,<br>
                        checked the usual places —<br>
                        school toilets,<br>
                        PE lessons,<br>
                        forms with tick boxes that stared back at me<br>
                        like I’d failed a multiple choice question<br>
                        on purpose.<br>
                        Gender used to feel important.<br>
                        Very serious.<br>
                        Very GCSE.<br>
                        Like something you’d revise for<br>
                        and still get wrong.<br>
                        Nothing.<br>
                        Turns out it’d moved<br>
                        to the weird shelf.<br>
                        Next to Inside No. 9,<br>
                        where things don’t explain themselves<br>
                        and the point only hits you<br>
                        after it’s already over.<br>
                        People ask when I “decided.”<br>
                        As if it was a meeting.<br>
                        As if I filled out a form<br>
                        instead of slowly realising<br>
                        I felt more at home<br>
                        with characters everyone else called unsettling.<br>
                        I didn’t lose my gender tragically.<br>
                        I misplaced it.<br>
                        Like something you lend someone<br>
                        and never get back<br>
                        but don’t really miss<br>
                        Like a DVD without a case<br>
                        If anyone does find my gender,<br>
                        it’s probably in a charity shop <br>
                        unlabelled,<br>
                        slightly unsettling,<br>
                        cult classic.<br>
                        Like something you lend someone<br>
                        and never get back<br>
                        but don’t really miss.

                    <p>
                        Sometimes I wish I were a real girl<br>
                        and I hate myself a little<br>
                        for even thinking the word real.<br>
                        Because I know the negatives.<br>
                        I’ve memorised them.<br>
                        Pain. Fear. Being talked over.<br>
                        Being watched like you owe the world softness.<br>
                        I recite them like a warning label<br>
                        to stop myself wanting it.<br>
                        It doesn’t work.<br>
                        Some days I look in the mirror<br>
                        and it’s fine.<br>
                        I shrug.<br>
                        I survive.<br>
                        I exist without flinching.<br>
                        Other days—<br>
                        I can’t meet my own eyes.<br>
                        The reflection feels like a draft version.<br>
                        Like someone clicked “save as”<br>
                        before it was finished.<br>
                        Everyone says girlhood is pain anyway.<br>
                        Periods and fear and walking home<br>
                        with keys between your fingers.<br>
                        Being told to smile.<br>
                        Being told to shrink.<br>
                        And I know that.<br>
                        I know that.<br>
                        I list the negatives like revision notes<br>
                        to convince myself<br>
                        I don’t want it that badly.<br>
                        But knowing something hurts<br>
                        doesn’t stop you wanting it.<br>
                        Fuck Marc.<br>
                        I don’t want some perfect version.<br>
                        I don’t want soft-focus Instagram girlhood.<br>
                        I want the stupid bits.<br>
                        The embarrassing bits.<br>
                        The standing in a bathroom at a party<br>
                        fixing someone’s eyeliner while crying<br>
                        for reasons that don’t make sense.<br>
                        I want to look at my reflection<br>
                        and not feel like I’m borrowing it.<br>
                        Some days I almost see her.<br>
                        Like she’s buffering.<br>
                        Like the screen’s frozen<br>
                        just before it loads properly.<br>
                        And other days—<br>
                        god—<br>
                        other days I can’t stand my reflection.<br>
                        I tilt my head.<br>
                        I pull a face.<br>
                        I tell myself it’s fine.<br>
                        I tell myself I’m being dramatic.<br>
                        And yeah—<br>
                        sometimes I’m okay.<br>
                        Sometimes I forget.<br>
                        Sometimes I laugh and exist<br>
                        and it doesn’t hurt at all.<br>
                        And that almost makes it worse.<br>
                        Because it proves it’s not constant.<br>
                        It’s not dramatic enough to explain.<br>
                        It just sneaks up on me<br>
                        in shop windows,<br>
                        bathroom mirrors,<br>
                        photos I didn’t know were being taken.<br>
                        I wish I were a real girl<br>
                        in the quiet way you wish for things<br>
                        you don’t say out loud<br>
                        because saying them<br>
                        makes them heavier.
